It's a comical yet devastating universe
But it's still the kind of universe that I deserve
The lipstick on my face has bled into my skin
It should show a grin

Up from the sky, I won't want you to cry
So here's an act for everyone to sneer at

So, Sing along, it's such a silly song
The cackling carousel, it spins and never stops
The acrobat who's waiting at the top
Should do a Circus Hop

(Instrumental)

I shall now accept the fact that I'm a failure (You're a failure)
'Cause I'm still afraid the future might be scarier (It is scarier)
I'll slip while having fun and cut off my own tongue
They'll think I was dumb

Up from the sky, I won't want you to cry
So here's an act for everyone to sneer at

So, Sing along, it's such a silly song
The cackling carousel, it spins and never stops
The acrobat who's waiting at the top
Should do a Circus Hop

(Instrumental)

I've said goodbye, I don't want you to cry
So have a laugh with everyone but me.

So, Sing along, it's such a silly song
The cackling carousel, it spins and never stops
The acrobat who fell down from the top
They did a little drop :)
So, Sing along, it's such a silly song
The cackling carousel, it spins and never stops
The acrobat who's waiting at the top
Should do a circus hop
